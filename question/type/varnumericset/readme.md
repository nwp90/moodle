# Variable numeric sets question type [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/moodleou/moodle-qtype_varnumericset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/moodleou/moodle-qtype_varnumericset)

A numerical question type for Moodle where one question can have
several variants with different numerical values. These variants
are given as a pre-defined list.

If the [Superscript/subscript editor](https://moodle.org/plugins/editor_ousupsub) is installed
then it can be used to let students enter their answer in scientific notation,
which can be checked in the grading. However, this is optional.


## Acknowledgements

The question type was created by Jamie Pratt (http://jamiep.org/) for
the Open University (http://www.open.ac.uk/).
