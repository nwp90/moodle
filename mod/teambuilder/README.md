Developed by UNSW, this is an advanced tool for building teams based off a set of criteria. You ask your students some questions, and then develop a predicate based off their answers for your teams. This is great if you want a little more control than "Assign Randomly" but less work than "Manual Allocation".

It's also a great drag-and-drop interface for building Groups; if you just want to make your groups yourself but hate the time-consuming Moodle method, then you can use Team Builder to make your life a bit easier.
