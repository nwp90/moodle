# More background colours for Atto

Modification of the backcolor plugin allowing the Moodle admin to define colors

## Installation

Install the plugin directory as usual in lib/editor/atto/plugins.

Then visit Site Administration > Plugins > Atto > More background colours to define the colours you want your users to be able to chose from. As a default, the same colours as the core atto_backcolor colours are defined.

Finally, enable the plugin by adding 'morebackcolors' (without the quotes) in the Atto toolbar settings.

## Thanks

Many thanks to Nicolas Dunand, whose [morefontcolors](https://github.com/ndunand/moodle-atto_morefontcolors) plugin this is copied from.
